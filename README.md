# 🤖 Agentic Chatbot

## 🚀 Overview

**Agentic Chatbot** is a next-generation AI assistant designed for flexibility, adaptability, and intelligence. Unlike traditional chatbots with fixed capabilities, it operates with an *agentic architecture*, allowing it to dynamically shift roles, choose the most appropriate language model (LLM), and decide when to pull real-time data via web search.

This is not just a chatbot—it's your **AI partner** that evolves with your intent.

## 💡 Inspiration

The idea stemmed from a simple need: a **truly adaptable AI assistant**. One that:
- Can play any role (e.g., tutor, researcher, productivity assistant).
- Knows which AI model is best suited for the task.
- Can retrieve live information using the web when needed.

We didn’t want just another chatbot—we wanted an **agent** that *thinks, switches, and adapts*.

## 🧠 What It Does

With **Agentic Chatbot**, users can:

- 🧑‍🏫 Assign it a **specific role** (e.g., tutor, assistant, researcher).
- 🔁 Choose from multiple **LLM backends** best suited for a given task.
- 🌍 Toggle **web search** to access real-time information on-demand.
- 🧩 Seamlessly interact with a system that adapts its tools and behavior intelligently.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

We built Agentic Chatbot using:

- 🧠 **LLM orchestration frameworks** (e.g., LangChain) for multi-model support.
- 🔄 **Agentic design patterns** to allow dynamic role-switching and context awareness.
- 🌐 **Tool integrations** (e.g., web search APIs) for real-time data access.
- ⚡ **Optimized API handling** for cost-effective, fast, and relevant responses.

## 💥 Challenges We Faced

- Balancing **flexibility** with **response accuracy**.
- Designing a smooth **tool-switching mechanism**.
- Ensuring **natural transitions** between roles and knowledge sources without losing context.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments We're Proud Of

- ✅ Role-based adaptability with real-time behavior shifts.
- ✅ Seamless integration of **web search** and **LLM knowledge**.
- ✅ A **scalable, modular architecture** built for future growth and plug-ins.
